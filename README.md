# NSExceptional/Bash
A bash workspace.

## Installation
If you already have a `.bashprofile` or `.bashrc`, you will want to merge them with the ones included in this repo.

Make sure you don't already have a `~/bash` folder or a `.PATH` file, or they will be overwritten. Then copy the contents of the `home` folder into your home directory with this command: `mv * ~`.
