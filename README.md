# NSExceptional/Bash
A bash workspace.

## Installation

Some files require Bash 4. On macOS, use Homebrew to install a new version of bash: `brew install bash`.

If you already have a `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc`, you will want to merge them with the ones included in this repo. Same for if you already have `~/bash` or `~/bin` folders or a `.PATH` file.

Simply clone this repo into your home folder. You can delete this file without Git complaining about it, too.
